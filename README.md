# Checkinstagramfollowers

This script is used to check who does not follow you back on instagram.

First, you need to go to instagram.com and download all the files relating to followers and following. 

This can be done by:
1. login into your account on instagram.com
2. click profile on the left sidebar
3. click on edit profile on the top
4. click on see more in the account center (should be the meta icon with a small list under it)
5. click on personal information and permissions
6. click download information
7. click download and transfer information
8. check your instagram account
9. click some of your information
10. scroll to you find connections
11. click on followers and following
12. then click download to device
13. change date range to user preference leave all other fields the same (I would select All Time)
14. click create files

You should get an email from instagram saying the information files that you requested are available. 

1. click download your information this should take you to instagram.com
2. click download
3. open your downloads on your computer there should be a file with the title instagram-yourname...
4. the two files that we are interested in are in the connections file
5. open the connections file
6. open the followers_and_following file
8. the files are called: follwers_1.html and following.html

Clone the git repo onto your computer. Once you have the repo on your local computer change the file paths to match the files paths in your computer. The code should return a list of people who dont follow you back. If everyone you follow follows you back you will get the message: Everyone you follow follows you back!.
